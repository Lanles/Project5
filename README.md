# Inventory Managment System

This is a project I made for managing an inventory system of a small business. The database is stored locally, and the user
has the ability to add customers, item categories, product, and also save the amount of product that was sold. This is in no way an advanced
means of storing important data and the database, if somebody wanted to, could easily be injected with malicious code. But also this was a project
I did in my free time as a learning experience for the C# programming language. (There may be some grammatical errors in the comments)
